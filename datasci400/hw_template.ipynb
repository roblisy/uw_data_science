    "- <b>Break the assignment into sections - one section per numbered requirement.</b> Each assignment has numbered requirements/instructions e.g. \"1. Read the CIFAR-10 dataset\". Each requirement should have at least one markdown cell and at least one code cell. Feel free to combine sections or make other sensible changes if that makes sense for your code and is still clear. The intent is to give you a useful structure and to make sure you get full credit for your work.\n",

    "Occasionally an assignment or milestone will ask you to do something other than write Python code e.g. ask you turn in a .docx file. In which case, please use logical structuring, but the specific notes above may not apply."
