He was also a supporter of Issac Newton's new theory of calculus with his publication, *An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst*.\n",

    "- Fisher argued that the selection of a Bayesian prior distribution was purely subjective, allowing one to achieve any answer desired.\n",
