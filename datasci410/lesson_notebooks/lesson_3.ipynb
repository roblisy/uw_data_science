    "## Basics of probability\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now investigate some basics of probability in a bit more detail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **discrete distribution** is a probability distribution describing a process with discrete outcomes. By discrete outcomes, we mean outcomes that have specific states which we can count. We have already investigated an example of a discrete process when we examined the outcome of dice throws. Each dice lands with a certain side up and the sum of the two numbers is the total score. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete distribution, the probability of an event, A, is the number of ways A can occur, divided by the number of total possible outcomes in our **sample space**, S. Let's make this concrete with an example. In the figure below there are 10 events in S, 6 in set A, and 4 in set B.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI410/img/Prob1.png\" style=\"height: 300px;\" alt=\"Sample Space s\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the events in a subset, A, given a set of possible events in the sample space, S, can be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{N(A)}{N(S)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case there are 10 events in S, 6 events in subset A, and 4 in subset B. We can compute the probabilities of A and B like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\\\\\n",
    "P(B) = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All probability distributions must have a certain properties, which we refer to as the **axioms of probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability for any event, A, is bounded between 0 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 \\le P(A) \\le 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability of the sample space is 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} P(a_i) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of two mutually exclusive events the sum of their probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \\Leftrightarrow A \\cap B = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we are treating events as mathematical sets and applying set operations to define the **intersection** $P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{2}{10}$ and **union** $P(A \\cup B) = \\frac{8}{10}$ of two events $A$ and $B$, as well as the **negation** of event $A$: $P(A)' = 1 - P(A) = \\frac{4}{10}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this basic operations to create more complex operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P((A \\cup B)') = P(A' \\cap B') = P(C) = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any two events $A$ and $B$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(A \\cap B) = 0$ if the two events are **mutually exclusive**, i.e. they can't happen at the same time."

    "\n",
    "For example, if you flip a fair coin the odds of getting heads are $1:1$ (1 in 1). Since there are only two possible equally likely outcomes in the coin flip, we say the odds of the outcome are even. As another example, if you roll a single fair dice your odds of rolling a 6 are $1:6$ (1 in 6), or 0.167.\n",

    "## Conditional probability and the Monty Hall problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The long running television game show, *Let's Make A Deal*, created and hosted by *Monty Hall*, had its heyday in the 1970s. At the finale of a show, Monty would tell the winning contestant that she could pick a one of three doors. Behind one door there would be a valuable prize, like a car. Worthless items, like a goat, were placed behind the other two doors. The contestant would pick a door. At this point Monty would build suspense by opening one of the other doors. Monty knew which door had the valuable prize, and would always reveal one of the worthless prizes. He would then tell the contestant that they could change their choice of doors. The question then is, should the contestant switch or stick with their original choice? The figure below illustrates the situation the contestant faces if they pick Door 1:\n",

    "  $$P(\\text{win car if no switch } | \\text{ picked door with goat}) = 0.0 * \\frac{2}{3} = 0.0$$\n",
    "-  There is a probability of 1/3 that your initial pick will be the only door with the car. \n",
    "  - At this point, with probability 1/2 Monty can open either of the other doors, as they both contain goats. If you switch door choices at this point you will win the car with probability 0:\n",
